          <h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
          <p>Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.
              Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?
              Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
              I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.
              So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.</p>

          <h3>Return of The Jedi</h3>
          <p>
              Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
              I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 
              The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
              Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 
              Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
